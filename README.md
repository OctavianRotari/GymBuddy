#Gym Buddy

##Introduction

I've developed this ios app for my final project at Makers Academy.  The
purpose of this app was to help people who are going to the gym to find other
people in the same area or at the same gym who are willing to workout with.  We
were working in a team of four people and we had a week to decide what
technologies we wanted to use, learn the new technologies and develope the
project.

Unfortunately 2 people felt unwell in that week so we remained in two working
on the app, I was mainly working on the back-end and the other person was
working on the front-end since he was a graphic designer.  At the end of the
week we managed to have an MVC to show.

##Approach

First we decided to sketch all the possible views and functionalities that from
our perspective should have been included in the MVC version of the app.  Then
we started discussing what technologies we could use to accomplish the
functionalities that the app should have.  After deciding the technologies we
did some tutorial to understand better the new technologies and then we started
developing the app.

##Conclusions

During this project I had learnt a lot, how to communicate with other people so
we all could agree on what to do and how to do so, I also learnt how to deal
with stress under pressure because of the fact that instead of being four
people we were just two working on the project and how to approach new
technologies by learning the key factors that characterize it.
